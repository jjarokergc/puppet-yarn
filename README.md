## Module Description

Yarn is a fast, reliable, and secure dependency manager for npm and bower. This Puppet module simplifies the task of installing it and supports
package, npm or source installation.

## Setup

### What yarn affects

* It will install Yarn.
* It will install `wget`, `tar` and `gzip` packages if you choose the source installation method.

**Node.js requirement:** Yarn requires Node.js to be installed, but this module will not do it. You need to install Node.js by your own, you can
use the [puppet-nodejs](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppet/nodejs) to do it. Examples are provided with this module.

### Beginning with yarn

To have Puppet install yarn with the default parameters, declare the yarn class:

```puppet
class { 'yarn': }
```

The Puppet module applies a default configuration: installs yarn using the recommended methods, package for Debian and RedHat families
and source for the rest. You can also use `npm` to install it.
Use the [Reference](#reference) section to find information about the class's parameters and their default values.

You can customize parameters when declaring the `yarn` class. For instance, this declaration will install yarn using the `npm` method
for the `foo` user:

```puppet
class { 'yarn':
  user           => 'foo',
  install_method => 'npm',
}
```

## Usage

### Installing Yarn

This is the most common usage for yarn. It installs yarn with default parameters.

```puppet
class { 'yarn': }
```

### Installing Yarn on CentOS with Node.js

The following code require that you add the [puppet-nodejs](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppet/nodejs) module also, but you can adapt it
for any other module.

```puppet
class { 'nodejs':
  repo_url_suffix => '6.x',
}

class { 'yarn': }

Package['nodejs'] -> Package['yarn']

if $facts['os']['family'] == 'RedHat' and $::operatingsystemrelease =~ /^5\.(\d+)/ {
  class { 'epel': }
  Class['epel'] -> Class['nodejs'] -> Class['yarn']
}

```

### Installing Yarn on Ubuntu with Node.js

The following code require that you add the [puppet-nodejs](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppet/nodejs) module also, but you can adapt it
for any other module.

```puppet
class { 'nodejs':
  repo_url_suffix => '6.x',
}

class { 'yarn': }

Package['nodejs'] -> Package['yarn']

```

### Installing Yarn on other Linux distros with Node.js

The following code require that you add the [puppet-nodejs](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppet/nodejs) module also, but you can adapt it
for any other module.

```puppet
class { 'nodejs':
  repo_url_suffix => '6.x',
}

class { 'yarn':
  manage_repo    => false,
  install_method => 'source',
  require        => Package['nodejs'],
}

```

### Installing Yarn using npm with Node.js

The following code require that you add the [puppet-nodejs](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppet/nodejs) module also, but you can adapt it
for any other module.

```puppet
class { 'nodejs':
  repo_url_suffix => '6.x',
}

class { 'yarn':
  manage_repo    => false,
  install_method => 'npm',
  require        => Class['nodejs'],
}

```

### Remove Yarn

```
class { 'yarn':
  package_ensure => 'absent',
}

```

## Reference

Details are into `REFERENCE.md` in puppet-strings format, excepted for OS dependent values of `yarn` class presented bellow.

#### `manage_repo`

Allos the module to manage the Yarn repo.

Default: `true` for Debian and RedHat, `false` for the rest.

#### `install_method`

Sets the installation method. Allowed values: `source`, `npm`, `package`.

Default: `package` for Debian and RedHat, `source` for the rest.

- Ensures packages `wget`, `tar` and `gzip` when `source` method is used.


## Limitations

This module can not work on Windows and should work on LINUX systems.

This module is CI tested against [open source Puppet](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/) on OSes declared in `metadata.json`.

This module should also work properly in other distributions and operating systems, such as FreeBSD, Gentoo, and Amazon Linux,
but is not formally tested on them.
